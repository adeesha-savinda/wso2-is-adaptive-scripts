# wso2-is-adaptive-scripts
This repository contains adaptive authentication scripts for authentication scenarios in WSO2 Identity Server that I have used to build POC's and test use cases for clients while working at WSO2.

## List of Available Scripts
- [`select-federated-authenticator-with-claim.js`](https://github.com/adeesha-savinda/wso2-is-adaptive-scripts/blob/main/select-federated-authenticator-with-claim.js): Selecting the federated authenticator based on the 'prefAuth' custom claim.
