# wso2-is-adaptive-scripts
This repo contains adaptive authentication scripts for authentication scenarios in WSO2 Identity Server that I have used to build POC's and test use cases for clients while working at WSO2.

## List of Available Scripts
- `select-federated-authenticator-with-claim.js`: Selecting the federated authenticator based on the 'prefAuth' claim.
